# Heapsort
Welcome to the HeapSort repository! This project features an efficient implementation of the HeapSort algorithm in Java. HeapSort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure. It's known for its efficiency and performance, particularly in scenarios requiring in-place sorting with minimal additional memory usage.

Features
---
Efficient Sorting: Implements the HeapSort algorithm to sort an array of elements in O(n log n) time complexity.
In-Place Sorting: Sorts the array without requiring additional space, making it memory efficient.
Stable and Reliable: Ensures consistent and predictable performance across various input sizes and distributions.

Implementation Details
---
This Java implementation of HeapSort includes the following key methods:

sort(Comparable[] a): The main method that sorts the array.
setHeap(Comparable[] a, int N): Converts the array into a binary heap.
sink(int k, int N, Comparable[] heap): Maintains the heap property by sinking an element down the heap.
exch(int i, int j, Comparable[] heap): Exchanges two elements in the array.
less(int i, int j, Comparable[] heap): Compares two elements in the array.
